# Cyclistic-BikeShare-Analysis

1. Business Task:
- The company wants to improve their earnings reaching out to their “casual” riders, and for that they have to analyze in what aspects the “casual” and the annual customers differ, to be able to create a focused and successful marketing message to the “casual” customers that makes them change to the annual subscription.

2. Key Stakeholders:
- The main stakeholders here are the director of marketing and my manager Lily Moreno, the rest of the marketing analytics team, and the Cyclistic executive team.

3. Steps Taken during Analysis:
- Determined credibility of data
- Sorted and filtered data
- Identified trends and relationships between data.

4. Conclusion:
- It seems that the casual users travel the same average distance than the member users, but they have much longer rides, that would indicate a more leisure oriented usage vs a more "public transport" or pragmatic use of the bikes by the annual members.
- This idea is reinforced by the fact that annual users have a very stable use of the service during the week, but the casual users are more of a weekend user.
- Here we can see that the annual members use both types of bikes for their rides, but the casual users show a clear preference for the electric bikes, which makes sense given the long duration of their rides.
- On a weekly basis we can see that for the annual members there is a small difference of usage between the start of the week, where they prefer the classic bike and the end of the week, where they use more electric bikes.
- For the casual users we see in general the same pattern of usage from the previous weekly charts, preferring the electric vs the classic bikes and having a weekend usage of the service.
